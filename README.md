# Music-Player

This was a small project i completed within the space of a week. It is a music player application that allows users to:
- Upload music files onto the app
- Create playlists and favourite songs
- Play, pause songs
- Use shuffle to listen
- Delete songs

There is currently an error where the time slider doesnt restart after pausing a song but the overall app works just fine.

Unadded features:
- Moving through the song by moving the time slider
