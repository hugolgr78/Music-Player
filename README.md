# Music-Player

This was a small project I completed within a week. It’s a **music player app** that offers essential music management features, allowing users to easily enjoy their music collection.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
- 🎶 **Upload Music Files**: Easily upload your music files into the app for playback.  
- 🎵 **Create Playlists**: Organize your music into playlists for easy access.  
- ❤️ **Favourite Songs**: Mark your favourite songs for quick listening.  
- ⏯️ **Play and Pause**: Control your music with simple play and pause functionality.  
- 🔀 **Shuffle Playback**: Enjoy your music in a random order with the shuffle feature.  
- ❌ **Delete Songs**: Remove unwanted songs from your collection.  

## ⚠️ Known Issue  
- 🚫 **Time Slider Bug**: Currently, the time slider doesn’t restart after pausing a song. However, this does not impact the overall functionality of the app.  

## 🚀 Unadded Features  
- ⏩ **Move Through Song**: The ability to move through the song by dragging the time slider is planned for future implementation.  

This project was a fun, quick development that gave me hands-on experience with building user-friendly applications in Python and Tkinter. It’s a simple yet functional app that showcases basic music playback and file management features.
